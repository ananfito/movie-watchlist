## Overivew

This solo project focuses on using REST API gather search results, based on user input, from the Open Movie Database. Then users have the ability to add those selected resutls to a movie wathclist which is displayed on another page on the site.

Requirements: 
- Two pages: index.html and watchlist.html
- Index is the search page
  - Makes call to OMBD API with the user-input search query and displays results 
- "add to watchlist" button which saves data to local storage
- watchlist.html laods and displays data from local storage

- [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

## My Process

For this project, I went back and forth between styling the pages and getting the REST API functionality to work properly. I started with getting the basic styles complete for the index.html and watchlist.html before adding styling for the search results and rendered watchlist. 

### Built with
